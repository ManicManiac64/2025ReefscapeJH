# 2025Reefscape

Team 6343's 2025 FRC robot code for Reefscape, currently known as Oil Spill. Oil Spill's code is written in Python and is based off of Robotpy's Commands V2 control system.

The code is divided into several packages and files, each responsible for a different aspect of the robot function. This README explains the function of each package, and some of the variable naming conventions used. Additional information about each specific class can be found in that class' Python file.

## Code Highlights
WIP

## File Functions

[`subsystems`](subsystems)

Contains the code for all subsystems. Each subsystem includes simulation support and data logging for match replay and analysis.

[`deploy`](deploy)

Contains all auto routines generated by PathPlanner and Choreo. Also includes all [Elastic](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard) layouts and [AdvantageScope](https://docs.advantagescope.org/) configurations.

[`lib/elasticlib.py`](lib/elasticlib.py)

Contains all Elastic code for manipulating the driver dashboard.

[`lib/limelight.py`](lib/limelight.py)

Contains the LimelightHelpers [translated from Java](https://github.com/LimelightVision/limelightlib-wpijava/blob/89accc690a9b5bc5cfb0914ebbb444d66dd8ce3b/LimelightHelpers.java) for reading Limelight data from NetworkTables.

[`tests/pyfrc_test.py`](tests/pyfrc_test.py)

Contains test code executed before code is deployed to the robot. This ensures that no uncaught errors get deployed to the robot, which could result in a devastating match loss.

[`robot_state.py`](robot_state.py)

Handles all robot position data and mechanism logging for dashboard use and analysis.
